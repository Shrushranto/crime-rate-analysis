# 🕵️ Crime Rate Analysis using Python & Power BI

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize crime trends across India using publicly available datasets. The focus is on three key categories:

- **Cyber Crime**
- **IPC Crimes (Indian Penal Code Crimes)**
- **Crimes Against Foreigners**

The analysis was conducted using **Python** for data exploration and preprocessing, and **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards. A comparative analysis was also done between **Cyber Crime** and **IPC Crimes** to study trends, severity, and patterns over time.

## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown

### 🔹 Cyber Crime
- Year-wise trend of cybercrime in India
- State-wise analysis of reported incidents
- Identification of hotspots and their causes
- Visuals: line graphs, choropleth maps, and bar charts

### 🔹 IPC Crimes
- Common types of IPC crimes (e.g., theft, assault)
- Region-wise distribution
- Year-on-year trends and seasonal variations
- Visuals: stacked bar charts, heatmaps, and trend lines

### 🔹 Crimes Against Foreigners
- Frequency and type of crimes reported by foreigners
- States with highest occurrence
- Percentage breakdowns by crime category
- Visuals: pie charts, state comparisons

### 🔄 Comparative Analysis
- Cyber Crime vs IPC Crime trends over time
- Crime rate comparison across states
- Correlation between tech adoption and cyber crime rise
- Key insights visualized in dual-line charts and tables
